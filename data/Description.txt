569 instances, 2 classes

Attributes:

	1) ID number 
	2) Diagnosis (M = malignant, B = benign) 
	3-32) 

	Ten real-valued features are computed for each cell nucleus: 

	a) radius (mean of distances from center to points on the perimeter) 
	b) texture (standard deviation of gray-scale values) 
	c) perimeter 
	d) area 
	e) smoothness (local variation in radius lengths) 
	f) compactness (perimeter^2 / area - 1.0) 
	g) concavity (severity of concave portions of the contour) 
	h) concave points (number of concave portions of the contour) 
	i) symmetry 
	j) fractal dimension ("coastline approximation" - 1)
